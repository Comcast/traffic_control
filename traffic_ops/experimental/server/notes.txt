 - Should we be returning 201 created with a Location: on successful post? more things like that? 
 - should we limit the ats files to know ats hosts and CRConfig to known CRConfig users, etc?
 - parameter.value and phys_location.* need manual intervetion (null.String) - run these fixes in postgres:

	 update parameter set value='' where value is NULL;
	 update phys_location set address='' where address is NULL;
	 update phys_location set state='' where state is NULL;
	 update phys_location set city='' where city is NULL;
	 update phys_location set zip='' where zip is NULL;
 
 - maybe it is better to just pass (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) to the actions, and have the action funcs write to w without returning?

 - conventions for view names, (tablenames, columns, fk refs, )
 - review tables parameter/profile, type, job, servercheck, to_extension

 - pass encoder which has the write
 - pass db, not db.GlobalDB
