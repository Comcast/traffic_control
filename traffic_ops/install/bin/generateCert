	We're now running a script to generate a self signed X509 SSL certificate.
	When prompted to enter a pass phrase, just enter 'pass' each time.  The
	pass phrase will be stripped from the private key before installation.

	When prompted to enter a 'challenge password', just hit the ENTER key.

	The remaining enformation Country, State, Locality, etc... are required to
	generate a properly formatted SSL certificate.
