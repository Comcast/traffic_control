Traffic Stats Administration
****************************
Installation
========================
Traffic Stats consists of three components:  Traffic Stats, InfluxDb, and Grafana.  Below are instructions on installing each component.

**Installing Traffic Stats:**

	- Download the Traffic Stats RPM from the traffic control `downloads <http://traffic-control-cdn.net/downloads/index.html>`_ page.
	- Copy the Traffic Stats RPM to your server
	- sudo rpm -ivh <traffic_stats rpm>

      Note:  This installation actually creates two separate services:  write_traffic_stats and ts_daily_summary.  More information on these services can be found in the overview section.     

**Installing InfluxDb:**

	In order to store traffic stats data you will need to install InfluxDb.  It is recommended InfluxDb be installed in a 3 server cluster; VMs are acceptable. The documentation for installing InfluxDb can be found on the InfluxDb `website <https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/introduction/installation.html>`_.

**Installing Grafana:**

	Grafana is used to display Traffic Stats/InfluxDb data in Traffic Ops.  Grafana is typically run on the same server as Traffic Stats but this is not a requirement.  Grafana can be installed on any server that can access InfluxDb and be accessed by Traffic Ops.  Documentation on installing Grafana can be found `here <http://docs.grafana.org/installation/>`_.

Configuration
=========================

**Configuring Traffic Stats:**

	Traffic Statsâ€™ configuration file can be found in /opt/traffic_stats/conf/traffic_stats.cfg.
	The following values need to be configured: 

	     - *toUser:* The user used to connect to Traffic Ops
	     - *toPasswd:*  The password to use when connecting to Traffic Ops
	     - *toUrl:*  The URL of the Traffic Ops server used by Traffic Stats
	     - *influxUser:*  The user to use when connecting to InfluxDb (if configured on InfluxDb, else leave default)
	     - *influxPassword:*  That password to use when connecting to InfluxDb (if configured, else leave blank)
	     - *polling interval:*  The interval at which Traffic Monitor is polled and stats are stored in InfluxDb
	     - *statusToMon:*  The status of Traffic Monitor to poll (poll ONLINE or OFFLINE traffic monitors)
	     - *seelogConfig:*  The absolute path of the seelong config file
	     - *dailySummaryPollingInterval:* The interval, in seconds, at which Traffic Stats checks to see if daily stats need to be computed and stored.

**Configuring InfluxDb:**

	At a minimum, InfluxDb will need to be configured for clutstering.  Documentation on clustering configuration can be found on the clustering page of the `InfluxDb Website <https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/concepts/clustering.html>`_.

**Configuring Grafana:**

	In order for grafana to integrate with Traffic Ops, it will need to be configured to allow anonymous authorization.  More information can be found on the configuration page of the `Grafana Website  <http://docs.grafana.org/installation/configuration/#authanonymous>`_. 

	Traffic Ops uses Grafana to display stats data to users.  In order for the graphs to display correctly, you will need to install the ``traffic_ops_scripted.js`` file from ``/traffic_control/traffic_stats/grafana`` to the ``/usr/share/grafana/public/dashboards/`` on the grafana server.  

	More information can be found in the `scripted dashboards <http://docs.grafana.org/reference/scripting/>`_ section of the Grafana documentation.

**Configuring Traffic Ops for Traffic Stats:**

	- The influxDb servers need to be added to Traffic Ops with profile = InfluxDb.  Make sure to use port 8086 in the configuration.
	- The traffic stats server should be added to Traffic Ops with profile = Traffic Stats.
	- Parameters for which stats will be collected are added with the release, but any changes can be made via parameters that are assigned to the Traffic Stats profile.
