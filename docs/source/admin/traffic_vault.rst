Traffic Vault Administration
****************************
Installing Traffic Vault
========================
In order to successfully store private keys you will need to install Riak.
The latest version of Riak can be downloaded on the Riak `website <http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/downloads/>`_.
The installation instructions for Riak can be found `here <http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/installing/>`_.

Production is currently running version 2.0.5 of Riak, but the latest version should suffice.


Configuring Traffic Vault
=========================
The following steps were taken to configure Riak in our environments.

Riak configuration file configuration
-------------------------------------

The following steps need to be performed on each Riak server in the cluster:

* Log into riak server as root

* cd to /etc/riak/

* Update the following in riak.conf to reflect your IP:
	- nodename = riak@a-host.sys.kabletown.net
	- listener.http.internal = a-host.sys.kabletown.net:8098 (can be 80 - This endpoint will not work with sec enabled)
	- listener.protobuf.internal = a-host.sys.kabletown.net:8087 (can be different port if you want)
	- listener.https.internal = a-host.sys.kabletown.net:8088 (can be 443)

* Updated the following conf file to point to your cert files
	- ssl.certfile = /etc/riak/certs/server.crt
	- ssl.keyfile = /etc/riak/certs/server.key
	- ssl.cacertfile = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

* Add a line at the bottom of the config for tlsv1
	- tls_protocols.tlsv1 = on

* Once the config file has been updated restart riak
	- ``/etc/init.d/riak restart``

* Validate server is running by going to the following URL:
 	- https://<serverHostname>:8088/ping

Riak-admin configuration
-------------------------

Riak-admin is a command line utility that needs to be run as root on a server in the riak cluster.

Assumptions:
	* Riak 2.0.2 or greater is installed
	* SSL Certificates have been generated (signed or self-signed)
	* Root access to riak servers

Add admin user and riakuser to riak
	* Admin user will be a super user
	* Riakuser will be the application user

Login to one of the riak servers in the cluster as root (any will do)

	1. Enable security

		``riak-admin security enable``

	2. Add groups

		``riak-admin security add-group admins``

		``riak-admin security add-group keysusers``
	3. Add users

	 .. Note:: username and password should be stored in /opt/traffic_ops/app/conf/<environment>/riak.conf
	 ..

		``riak-admin security add-user admin password=<AdminPassword> groups=admins``

		``riak-admin security add-user riakuser password=<RiakUserPassword> groups=keysusers``

	4. Grant access for admin and riakuser

		``riak-admin security add-source riakuser 0.0.0.0/0 password``

		``riak-admin security add-source admin 0.0.0.0/0 password``

	5. Grant privs to admins for everything

		``riak-admin security grant riak_kv.list_buckets,riak_kv.list_keys,riak_kv.get,riak_kv.put,riak_kv.delete on any to admins``

	6. Grant privs to keysuser for ssl, dnssec, and url_sig_keys buckets only

		``riak-admin security grant riak_kv.get,riak_kv.put,riak_kv.delete on default ssl to keysusers``

		``riak-admin security grant riak_kv.get,riak_kv.put,riak_kv.delete on default dnssec to keysusers``

		``riak-admin security grant riak_kv.get,riak_kv.put,riak_kv.delete on default url_sig_keys to keysusers``

.. seealso:: For more information on security in Riak, see the `Riak Security documentation <http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.4/ops/advanced/security/>`_.
.. seealso:: For more information on authentication and authorization in Riak, see the `Riak Authentication and Authorization documentation <http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.4/ops/running/authz/>`_.


Traffic Ops Configuration
-------------------------

There are a couple configurations that are necessary in Traffic Ops.

1. Database Updates
	* A new profile for Riak needs to be added to the profile table
	* A new type of Riak needs to be added to the type table
	* The servers in the Riak cluster need to be added to the server table

	 .. Note:: profile and type data should be pre-loaded by seeds sql script.
	 ..

2. Configuration updates
	* /opt/traffic_ops/app/conf/<environment>/riak.conf needs to be updated to reflect the correct username and password for accessing riak.

Configuring Riak Search
=======================

In order to more effectively support retrieval of SSL certificates by Traffic Router and Traffic Ops ORT, Traffic Vault uses `Riak search <http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/latest/using/reference/search/>`_.  Riak Search uses `Apache Solr <http://lucene.apache.org/solr>`_ for indexing and searching of records.  The following explains how to enable, configure, and validate Riak Search.

Riak Configuration
------------------

On Each Riak Server:

1. If java is not already installed on your Riak server, install Java
	* To see if Java is already installed: ``java -version``
	* To install Java: ``yum install -y jdk``

2. enable search in riak.conf
	* ``vim /etc/riak/riak.conf``
	* look for search and change ``search = off`` to ``search = on``

3. Restart Riak so search is on
	* ``service riak restart``

One time configuration:
1. On one of the Riak servers in the cluster run the following riak-admin commands
	``riak-admin security grant search.admin on schema to admin``
	``riak-admin security grant search.admin on index to admin``
	``riak-admin security grant search.query on index to admin``
	``riak-admin security grant search.query on index sslkeys to admin``
	``riak-admin security grant search.query on index to riakuser``
	``riak-admin security grant search.query on index sslkeys to riakuser``
	``riak-admin security grant riak_core.set_bucket on any to admin``

2. Add the search schema to Riak.  This schema is a simple Apache Solr configuration file which will index all records on cdn, hostname, and deliveryservice.
	* Get the schema file by either cloning the project and going to `traffic_ops/app/config/misc/riak_search` or from `github <https://github.com/Comcast/traffic_control/tree/master/traffic_ops/app/conf/misc/riak_search>`_.
	* Use curl to add the schema to riak: ``curl -kvs -XPUT "https://admin:pass@riakserver:8088/search/schema/sslkeys" -H 'Content-Type:application/xml'  -d @sslkeys.xml``

3. Add search index to Riak
	* run the following curl command:  ``curl -kvs -XPUT "https://admin:pass@riakserver:8088/search/index/sslkeys" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"schema":"sslkeys"}'``

4. Associate the sslkeys index to the ssl bucket in Riak
	* run the following curl command: ``curl -kvs -XPUT "https://admin:pass@riakserver:8088/buckets/ssl/props" -H'content-type:application/json' -d'{"props":{"search_index":"sslkeys"}}'``

Riak Search (using Apache Solr) will now index all NEW records that are added to the "ssl" bucket.  The cdn, deliveryservice, and hostname fields are indexed and when a search is performed riak will return the indexed fields along with the crt and key values for a ssl record.  In order to add the indexed fields to current records and to get the current records added, a standalone script needs to be run.  The following explains how to run the script.

1. Get script from github either by cloning the project and going to `traffic_ops/app/script` or from `here <https://github.com/Comcast/traffic_control/blob/master/traffic_ops/app/script/update_riak_for_search.pl>`_
2. Run the script by performing the following command ``./update_riak_for_search.pl -to_url=https://traffic-ops.kabletown.net -to_un=user -to_pw=password``

Validate the search is working by querying against Riak directly:
``curl -kvs "https://admin:password@riakserver:8088/search/query/sslkeys?wt=json&q=cdn:mycdn"``

Validation can also be done by querying Traffic Ops:
``curl -Lvs -H "Cookie: $COOKIE" https://traffic-ops.kabletown.net/api/1.2/cdns/name/title-vi/sslkeys.json``
