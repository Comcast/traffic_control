***********************************
Configure Delivery Service Steering
***********************************

1)  Create two target delivery services in Traffic Ops.  They must both be HTTP delivery services that are part of the same CDN.

4) Create a user with the role of Steering.

5) As the steering user, assign weights to target delivery services.  This will require logging in to Traffic Ops first via ``http://to.kabletown.net/api/1.2/user/login`` and storing the mojolicious cookie.

	Sample cURL: ``curl -H "Cookie: mojolicious=xxxyyy" -XPUT "https://to.kabletown.net/internal/api/1.2/steering/steering-ds" -d @/tmp/steering.json``

	Sample JSON body:

::

   {
    "targets": [
     {
       "weight": "1000",
       "deliveryService": "target-deliveryservice-1"
     },
     {
       "weight": "9000",
       "deliveryService": "target-deliveryservice-2"
     }
    ]
   }

6) If desired, the steering user can create filters for the target delivery services.

	Sample cURL: ``curl -H "Cookie: mojolicious=xxxyyy" -XPUT "https://to.kabletown.net/internal/api/1.2/steering/steering-ds" -d @/tmp/steering.json``

	Sample JSON body:

::

   {
    "filters": [
     {
       "pattern": ".*\\gototarget1\\..*",
       "deliveryService": "target-deliveryservice-1"
     }
    ],
    "targets": [
     {
       "weight": "1000",
       "deliveryService": "target-deliveryservice-1"
     },
     {
       "weight": "9000",
       "deliveryService": "target-deliveryservice-2"
     }
    ]
   }

7) Any requests to Traffic Router for the steering delivery service should now be routed to target delivery services based on configured weight.  Example: ``curl -Lvs http://tr.steering-ds.cdn.kabletown.net/foo``
