Database Management
===================
..  Add db naming conventions

The admin.pl script is for use in managing the Traffic Ops database tables. Below is an example of its usage. 

``$ db/admin.pl``

Usage:  db/admin.pl [--env (development|test|production)] [arguments]

Example: ``db/admin.pl --env=test reset``

Purpose:  This script is used to manage the database. The environments are defined in the dbconf.yml, as well as the database names.

+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Arguments | Description                                                        |
+===========+====================================================================+
| create    | Execute db 'create' the database for the current environment.      |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| down      | Roll back a single migration from the current version.             |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| drop      | Execute db 'drop' on the database for the current environment.     |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| redo      | Roll back the most recently applied migration, then run it again.  |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| reset     | Execute db drop, create, load_schema, migrate on the database for  |
|           | the current environment.                                           |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| seed      | Execute SQL from db/seeds.sql for loading static data.             |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| setup     | Execute db drop, create, load_schema, migrate, seed on the         |
|           | database for the current environment.                              |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| status    | Print the status of all migrations.                                |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| upgrade   | Execute migrate then seed on the database for the current          |
|           | environment.                                                       |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

Installing The Developer Environment
====================================
To install the Traffic Ops Developer environment:

1. Clone the traffic_control repository from `github.com <https://github.com/Comcast/traffic_control>`_.
2. Install the local dependencies using Carton (cpanfile).

  ::

   $ cd traffic_ops/app
   $ carton

3. Set up a user in MySQL.

  Example: :: 

    master $ mysql
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 305
    Server version: 5.6.19 Homebrew

    Copyright (c) 2000, 2014, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

    Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its
    affiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective
    owners.

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    mysql> create user ‘to_user’@’localhost’;
    mysql> grant all on to_development.* to 'to_user'@'localhost' identified by 'twelve';
    mysql> grant all on to_test.* to 'to_user'@'localhost' identified by 'twelve';
    mysql> grant all on to_integration.* to 'to_user'@'localhost' identified by 'twelve';


4. Enter ``db/admin.pl --env=<enviroment name> setup`` to set up the traffic_ops database(s). 

   * Unit test database: ``$ db/admin.pl --env=test setup``
   * Development database: ``$ db/admin.pl --env=development setup``
   * Integration database: ``$ db use db/admin.pl --env=integration setup``

   |

   Running the the admin.pl script in setup mode should look like this: ::

       master $ db/admin.pl --env=development setup
       Using database.conf: conf/development/database.conf
       Using database.conf: conf/development/database.conf
       Using database.conf: conf/development/database.conf

       Using database.conf: conf/development/database.conf
       Using database.conf: conf/development/database.conf
       Executing 'drop database to_development'
       Executing 'create database to_development'
       Creating database tables...
       Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

       Seeding database...
       Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

5. (Optional) To load temporary data into the tables: ``$ perl bin/db/setup_kabletown.pl``


6. To start Traffic Ops, enter ``$ bin/start.sh``

   The local Traffic Ops instance uses an open source framework called morbo, starting following the start command execution.

   Start up success includes the following:

  ::
   

   [2015-02-24 10:44:34,991] [INFO] Listening at "http://*:3000".
   
   Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.


7. Using a browser, navigate to the given address: ``http://127.0.0.1:3000``
8. For the initial log in:
  
  * User name: admin
  * Password: password

9. Change the log in information.

Test Cases
==========
Use prove to execute test cases. Execute after a carton install:

* To run the Unit Tests: ``$ local/bin/prove -qrp  t/``
* To run the Integration Tests: ``$ local/bin/prove -qrp t_integration/``

The KableTown CDN example
-------------------------
The integration tests will load an example CDN with most of the features of Traffic Control being used. This is mostly for testing purposes, but can also be used as an example of how to configure certain features. To load the KableTown CDN example and access it:

1. Run the integration tests 
2. Start morbo against the integration database: ``export MOJO_MODE=integration; ./bin/start.sh``
3. Using a browser, navigate to the given address: ``http://127.0.0.1:3000``
4. For the initial log in:
  
  * User name: admin
  * Password: password


Extensions
==========
Traffic Ops Extensions are a way to enhance the basic functionality of Traffic Ops in a custom manner. There are three types of extensions:

1. Check Extensions

  These allow you to add custom checks to the "Health->Server Checks" view.

2. Configuration Extensions

  These allow you to add custom configuration file generators.

3. Data source Extensions

  These allow you to add statistic sources for the graph views and APIs.

Extensions are managed using the $TO_HOME/bin/extensions command line script. For more information see :ref:`admin-to-ext-script`.

Check Extensions
----------------

In other words, check extensions are scripts that, after registering with Traffic Ops, have a column reserved in the "Health->Server Checks" view and that usually run periodically out of cron.

.. |checkmark| image:: ../../../traffic_ops/app/public/images/good.png 

.. |X| image:: ../../../traffic_ops/app/public/images/bad.png


It is the responsibility of the check extension script to iterate over the servers it wants to check and post the results.

An example script might proceed by logging into the Traffic Ops server using the HTTPS base_url provided on the command line. The script is hardcoded with an auth token that is also provisioned in the Traffic Ops User database. This token allows the script to obtain a cookie used in later communications with the Traffic Ops API. The script then obtains a list of all caches to be polled by accessing Traffic Ops' ``/api/1.1/servers.json`` REST target. This list is walked, running a command to gather the stats from that cache. For some extensions, an HTTP GET request might be made to the ATS astats plugin, while for others the cache might be pinged, or a command run over SSH. The results are then compiled into a numeric or boolean result and the script POSTs tha result back to the Traffic Ops ``/api/1.1/servercheck/`` target.

A check extension can have a column of |checkmark|'s and |X|'s (CHECK_EXTENSION_BOOL) or a column that shows a number (CHECK_EXTENSION_NUM).A simple example of a check extension of type CHECK_EXTENSION_NUM that will show 99.33 for all servers of type EDGE is shown below: :: 


  Script here.

Check Extension scripts are located in the $TO_HOME/bin/checks directory.

Currently, the following Check Extensions are available and installed by default:

**Cache Disk Usage Check - CDU**
  This check shows how much of the available total cache disk is in use. A "warm" cache should show 100.00.

**Cache Hit Ratio Check - CHR**
  The cache hit ratio for the cache in the last 15 minutes (the interval is determined by the cron entry). 

**DiffServe CodePoint Check - DSCP**
  Checks if the returning traffic from the cache has the correct DSCP value as assigned in the delivery service. (Some routers will overwrite DSCP)

**Maximum Transmission Check - MTU**
  Checks if the Traffic Ops host (if that is the one running the check) can send and receive 8192 size packets to the ``ip_address`` of the server in the server table.

**Operational Readiness Check - ORT**
  See :ref:`reference-traffic-ops-ort` for more information on the ort script. The ORT column shows how many changes the traffic_ops_ort.pl script would apply if it was run. The number in this column should be 0. 

**Ping Check - 10G, ILO, 10G6, FQDN**
  The bin/checks/ToPingCheck.pl is to check basic IP connectivity, and in the default setup it checks IP connectivity to the following:
  
  10G
    Is the ``ip_address`` (the main IPv4 address) from the server table pingable?
  ILO
    Is the ``ilo_ip_address`` (the lights-out-mangement IPv4 address) from the server table pingable?
  10G6
    Is the ``ip6_address`` (the main IPv6 address) from the server table pingable?
  FQDN 
    Is the Fully Qualified Domain name (the concatenation of ``host_name`` and ``.`` and ``domain_name`` from the server table) pingable?

**Traffic Router Check - RTR**
  Checks the state of each cache as perceived by all Traffic Monitors (via Traffic Router). This extension asks each Traffic Router for the state of the cache. A check failure is indicated if one or more monitors report an error for a cache. A cache is only marked as good if all reports are positive. (This is a pessimistic approach, opposite of how TM marks a cache as up, "the optimistic approach")

API
===
The Traffic Ops API provides programmatic access to read and write CDN data providing authorized API consumers with the ability to monitor CDN performance and configure CDN settings and parameters.

Response Structure
------------------
All successful responses have the following structure: ::

    {
      "response": <JSON object with main response>,
      "version": "1.1"
    }

To make the documentation easier to read, only the ``<JSON object with main response>`` is documented, even though the response and version fields are always present. 

Using API Endpoints
-------------------
1. Authenticate with your Traffic Portal or Traffic Ops user account credentials.
2. Upon successful user authentication, note the mojolicious cookie value in the response headers. 
3. Pass the mojolicious cookie value, along with any subsequent calls to an authenticated API endpoint.

Example: ::
